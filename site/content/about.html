<h1>About Peezy</h1>

<p>Peezy is a micro-CMS built in Node.js.</p>

<p>Using it is very easy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>clone this repo</li>
	<li>customize the theme in /site/themes/default</li>
	<li>add content to /site/content/</li>
	<li>start the server</li>
</ul>

This is my experiment in building a minimalist flat file publishing engine built around Express.js. Inspired heavily by WordPress, Jekyll and Harp.

Not quite functional yet - Work in progress!
