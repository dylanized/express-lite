# Peezy Demo Site

Peezy is a micro-CMS built in Node.js. 

Using it is easy:

- clone this repo
- customize the theme in /themes/default
- add content .html files to /content/pages
- start the server

This is my experiment in building a minimalist flat file publishing engine built around Express.js. Inspired heavily by WordPress, Jekyll and Harp.

Not quite functional yet - Work in progress!
