# Peezy

Peezy is a micro-CMS for Node.js. 

Using it is easy:

- clone this repo
- npm install
- add content to /site/content/
- customize the theme in /site/themes/default
- start the server

This is an experiment in building a minimalist flat-file publishing engine built on Express.js. Inspired heavily by WordPress, Jekyll and Harp.

Not quite functional yet - Work in progress!
